# Contribution Guideline

## What to contribute ?

You might be an expert in a specific field of study, you can contribute the ways and means to master your field of study. 

- This should be list of subject, your suggested book titles with all its author names, edition may or may not be added, with the links to any online internations book store like [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) or Book Review Collection website like [GoodReads.com](http://GoodReads.com). 

- You can give importance of the subject and if possible the current industry relevancy of the subject. 

- You can suggest upto five book titles for a given subject.

- Importance of the purpose the book serves not more than 50 words. 

- Give any supplementary reading that should be learned in addition to the book.

- Any special instructions that you want to tell the learner for eg. Solving exercise / problems of each chapters in the book.

- Suggest any device or instruments that you need to buy before you actually learn that subject, with some specs / model, link to purchase.

    - For eg. 
    - Scienfic Calculator to learn Statistics. 
    - Breadboard to learn prototyping electronics.

- Any special instructions for the learners if you have any.

- Importantly the order of the subject / books in which they have to be learned. I emphasis on the order because. Order is very important. You cannot learn to write sentence before you know the words and you cannot learn to form a word without knowing the alphabets. This is no-brainer that can be easily understood. What about a complex field like Aeronautical Engineering, Mechanical engineering, Computer Science. What should be learned first what should follow them next has to be figured out. For a self learner this is very important.
