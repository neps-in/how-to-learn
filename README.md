# How to learn

This contains ways and means to learn or master a field of study. This is a collection of series of books and the order in which they have to be learned.
This is in a motive to help the college dropouts or who is less privileged over the others to visit college and be educated, but still have the urge or  need to learn and curious mind.

Of-course you need discipline to learn, which i may or may not cover in this collection.

# Why this document ?
- The Internet is overwhelming and highly polluted, adultrated with lots of mis leading content. Should I fix it ? before that Can I fix it ? No, its impossible an individual to fix it. Its way beyond my scope. 

- Academic Institutions are there. They should be doing the great job in the right way ? The sad answer is no. Academic institutions have become *knowlege seller*, _They promise that they will make rich every students who come in to their students and only they (acadamic institutions) become rich in the end._ 

- Academic institutions are becoming way more expensive and getting more expensive to be affordable to everyone. 

- This is an effort to help someone to aspire to be a self taught genius or at least scholar.

So as a strong believer of collective intelligence this is a way that I feel that it can help.

- This repository will have ways and means to master or at least to learn every field of study.
