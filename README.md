# How To Learn Guide - A Guide Self Learners aka Self Made Genius

This is a collection of How to learn guide different field of science for self learners.

This contains ways and means to learn and master a field of study.

This is a collection of series of books and the order in which they have to be learned.

This is in a motive to help the college dropouts or who is less privileged over the others to visit college and be educated, but still have the urge or  need to learn and curious mind.

Of-course you need discipline to learn, which i may or may not cover in this collection.

## Why this repository ?

The Internet is overwhelming and highly polluted, adultrated, search egine optimized information with lots of mis leading content. 

## Should I fix it ?

before that Can I fix it ? No, its impossible for an individual to fix it. Its way beyond my scope also

## Can Academic Institutions fix it ?

Academic Institutions are established initially to impart education.The sad answer is no. Every piece of education you are expected to receive is commertialised on over valuation. Academic institutions have become *knowlege seller*, They promise that they will make rich every students who come into their institutions and **ironically only they (acadamic institutions) become rich in the end.**

Academic institutions are becoming way more expensive and getting more expensive to be affordable for people with average to less income.

## Whats the solution ?

I am creating this guide as a repository for self learning guide.

This is an effort to help someone who aspire to be a self taught genius or least scholar.

## What does this repository contains ?

So as a strong believer of collective intelligence this is a way that I feel that it can help.

This repository will have ways and means to master or at least to learn different field of study.

This repository will contain list of Best Literature / Books that can be used to learn.

This repository will also contain the order in which you have to learn the subject for the following reason. I emphasis on the order because. Order is very important. You cannot learn to write sentence before you know the words and you cannot learn to form a word without knowing the alphabets. This is no-brainer that can be easily understood. What about a complex field like Aeronautical Engineering, Mechanical engineering, Computer Science. What should be learned first what should follow them next has to be figured out. For a self learner this is very important.
